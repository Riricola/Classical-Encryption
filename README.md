# Classical-Encryption
Mini Project 1

I have two java files, Ceasar Cipher and Vigenere Cipher, both performing their respective cipher. To run Ceasar 
Cipher on the command line, type "java" + the name of the file + "encode"/"decode" + a string you'd like to encrypt. 
To run the Vigenere Cipher on the command line, type "java" + the name of the file + "encode"/"decode" + a string 
you'd like to encrypt + the key you'd like to use.
